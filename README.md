Classic Snake Game

Wanted to make a game from my childhood that I had great enjoyment with while stealing my mom's nokia phone

To biuld this game is used Vanilla JS, JQuery, HTML/Canvas, and the minimal amount of CSS I could to give color

Building this game was a great learning experience, showing me how many ways there are to make a game. I learned that just because a game appears to be very minimalistic, it is in fact very complex to build

Looking back, I would have: started earlier, utilizing the little free-time I had on vacation; chosen a different game and better planning on what I needed and had to do. 

My main struggle was the game flow- steps that needed to be done in order and processes of doing those steps and how the effect the game as a whole. 

As for my next steps, I would like to: "complete" the game by updating score and move food once it's been eaten, add additional stying and animation so the snake moves without keys being pressed, and a reason to play the game- I.e. a winner and a loser if playing with multiple players.
